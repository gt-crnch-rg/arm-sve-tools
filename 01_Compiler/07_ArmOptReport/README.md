# Arm Optimization Report

This example demonstrates the Arm Compiler for Linux's `arm-opt-report` tool.
Arm Optimization Report is a feature of Arm Compiler for Linux version 20.0 
and later that builds upon the llvm-opt-report tool available in open-source 
LLVM. Arm Optimization Report makes it easier to see what optimization 
decisions the compiler is making, in-line with your source code.
